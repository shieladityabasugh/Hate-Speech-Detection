# Hate-Speech-Detection
The goal of this project is to detect hate or offensive speech in any public platform. We have used the data from a popular social media website X (previously known as Twitter).

We sourced the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset.
This is a dataset that was used to research hate-speech detection. The text is classified as: hate-speech, offensive language, and neither.
Due to the nature of the study, it is important to note that this dataset contains text that can be considered racist, sexist, homophobic, or generally offensive.

Shout out to Aarshi Shaikh and Prashant Srivastava for their inputs!
